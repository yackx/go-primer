# Go Primer

A very brief introduction to the Go programming language (go-lang):

* Variables
* Arrays
* Slices
* Maps
* Iterate / range
* Functions

For illustration purposes only. This is by no way a complete course on Go!
Experiment on the [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/).
Find out much more on the excellent [Go by Example website](https://gobyexample.com/).
